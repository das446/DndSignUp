As a huntsman in training you will start off in Beacon academy, one of the most prestigious learning facilities for huntsman in training, training to combat against the Creatures of Destruction called Grimm.

Of course there will be familiar villains too such as Roman Torchwick and Neo, and also Cinder Fall. Do you have what it takes to save the land of Remnant and keep the peace of the land safe?

11:00 AM|Eleventh Hour|Kamal|40K.png|"It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries, the Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day so that He may never truly die. Yet in His deathless state, the Emperor continues His eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies engage in battle in His name on uncounted worlds, but for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants, and worse. To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruellest and most bloody regime imaginable. Only War is a military roleplaying game in which players take the roles of Imperial Guardsmen in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Using a percentile dice system, 4-6 players will attempt to return to friendly lines before and orbital bombardment wipes their position from the face of the moon they have been fighting for the past few weeks..<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy4CJ4F-epA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy4CJ4F-epA</a>!!
11:00 AM|Scion Heroes|Vince|scion.png|It is the year 2050 for awhile not much have changed. However there have been reports of mysterious creatures and monsters appearing in various places. You the player are assumed to be like any other human beings. However throughout your life you appear to be better than the average human being. Weirdly enough you've been gift a random item with the sender claiming to be your parent. You grasp the item in hand, with it you receive a surge of mystical power. You are now a scion, a soon to be demigod of your parent god, but just who is this mythical parent? That is what you will find out, Journey the world and uncover its hidden secrets. Scion heroes is a mythological tabletop rpg. Where players play as an offspring of a god of the existing pantheons that we know of. They will have powers and potential to shape what they will become. This game runs similarly to exalted as a D10 success based system. In this system players roll a number of D10s to pass a threshold inorder determine whether they succeed in an action. However I'll be using a fan modified version of the original that will be more friendly to new players.!!
11:00 AM|Hyperlanes Alpha|Michael|hyperlanes.png|The Year 3800 has been a major success for space exploration, alien contact, and the advancement of technology. The pinnacle of all these advancements would be the mobilized planet called Alpha. Alpha began as an experiment as a modular space station that could be added on to, eventually different species found interest in the station and added on their own module. Eventually, the station grew with every new species adding on, and eventually, Alpha had to be recognized as its own functioning ecosystem. Alpha had to create its own functioning laws as no one species had the optimal way of living for us all. Eventually 10 factions were created each providing something integral to the newly established society. But what's not normally seen is that each faction has a darker side to their members and ideals. Explore the vast, changing environment of Alpha as tensions rise among the factions. There will be as much danger as there is political intrigue. Hyperlanes is a modified DnD 5e setting designed to bring players into the stars. With that said, Hyperlanes will use a standard D20 check system. Hyperlanes is just as approachable as DnD so newcomers and veterans alike will have no problem getting familiar with it.!!
11:00 AM|World Without Light|George||Imagine a world where light is a rarity, where utter and complete darkness reigns supreme, and where mankind is in a constant fight for its life against the ever encroaching shadows. Players will take on the role of elite adventurers who were hired to find and deal with a strange monster that has been driving people insane while creating horrifying abominations. World Without Light is a custom system primarily based on the Warhammer d100 systems. Players will have to be careful as physical injury is not the only way their character can fall in combat. Insanity is a common affliction in this world and the darkness that surrounds them has a strange way of corrupting those who venture into it without a source of light. All players are welcome, but be warned that while fun is guaranteed, victory and survival are not. There is space for 4-6!!
2:20 PM|DnD 5E|Cody||A RPG set in a fantasy setting with magic and swords. Mainly focused on combat and dungeon crawl. the campain will be a group of adventurers clearing a cave system in the hopes for weath and fame.!!
2:20 PM|Curse of the Yellow Sign Digging for a Dead God|Steven|call-of-cthulhu.png|In May of 1939, somewhere in the jungles of the Congo, a small band of soldiers have stumbled across something ancient. Something terrible. And they are about to suffer the consequences. Digging for a Dead God is a Call of Cthulhu adventure in which the players take the roles of pre-WWII Nazi soldiers in the African wilderness, ostensibly digging for diamonds, but finding something much more terrifying. But this ancient threat is not your only problem: half of your underlings are sick, the natives are getting restless, and you've been receiving some funny looks from your fellow officers. In this adventure, death comes easily, and insanity even easier, but do not fear: death is not the end, and at times can be even more fun than being alive. And besides, will anyone really complain over a few dead Nazis? Call of Cthulhu is a cosmic horror RPG system based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Unlike many other popular systems, your character will not be some super-powered, demigod-like being; you will be an ordinary human with very human capabilities, fighting beings that defy our very conception of reality. It is a percentile system, where success is determined by rolling a 100-sided die and seeing if it is lower than a stat or skill value. *Note: This adventure contains extreme violence and graphic imagery, and it is very likely many characters will die (this will not remove players from the game).!!
2:20 PM|Inheritance|Sam|exalted.png|In the world of creation lies the Exalts, the champions of the gods are granted immense power. There are the Dragon-Blooded, the Lunars, the Sidereals, and the Solars whose history is stained with slander and blood. The Solars once ruled creation until they were betrayed by the Sidereals and Dragon-Blooded. This was many years ago in the Golden Age. Now in the Bronze Age, the Dragon-Blooded rule and have convinced most people that Solars are mere daemons taking the form of the person whom they have killed. This brought rise to the Wild Hunt, a group of elite Dragon-Blooded who hunt Solars across the world.To ensure that a solar's spirit would not seek vengeance they are buried in lavish tombs full of treasures, artifacts, and dangerous traps and now after weeks of dangerous travel you find yourself mere moments away from the tomb of the legendary artificer, The Ingenuity of Forsaken Wisdom. Exalted is a High Fantasy Cinematic RPG system. You play as a Solar one of the chosen exalts of the Unconquered Sun, an already exception person granted more power to use as you see fit. This is a D10 system that measures numbers of successes in order to determine how well you handled the task. The game has a more abstract combat system with initiative being the edge you hold over your opponent not just when you act as well as a stunting system which grants the player bonuses for better and more creative descriptions for their actions.(edited)!!
2:20 PM|Data Plan Out Of Time|Zach||"Friday afternoon. You and your friends have met up at your place, ready to unwind after a long week of work and classes. Your phone buzzes. You've got a voicemail. You open it, and are surprised to hear your own voice. ""Hey, what's up, man? This is gonna sound crazy, but I'm you from the future. Listen, whatever you do, it is extremely important that you don't-"" click Risus (Latin for 'laughter') is an extremely rules-light, D6-based RPG system, designed primarily for light-hearted one-shots. Novice-friendly."!!
2:20 PM|A Past That Could Have Been|Chelsea|BlackVoid.png|In the days when Babylon was the greatest city on Earth, mankind lived in placid ignorance of the grandeur, vastness, and horror of the Cosmos... though such tranquility does not often last. A series of deafening rumbles shook the Earth and black mist began to fill the sky. Mankind stared in horrified awe as the sky itself tore apart, revealing massive shadowy figures and incomprehensible darkness. As Earth was torn asunder, the obliviousness of mankind was shattered and the truth of existence revealed. Ripped from their home and scattered across the Cosmos, humanity was forced into a new struggle for survival in a far more cruel and chaotic world. Generations later, you are the pure-blooded and half-blooded descendants of those few humans that managed to survive. Whether by luck, skill, or sheer force of will, you find yourself in Llyhn the Eternal, perhaps the greatest city in the Cosmos, wondering what humanity can do to make itself a place among the stars. (4-5 players) Mechanics Black Void is a high-horror, low-fantasy role playing game with heavy Eldritch horror and ancient Middle Eastern themes. The system uses a D12-based DC Check system (similar to D&D) and a manoeuver-based combat system that keeps things varied. It is freeform and suited well to both intrigue and combat focused campaigns, where every choice has its benefits as well as its drawbacks. Warning: While this system does contain serious topics and graphic scenes (mostly concerning slavery, semi-graphic violence, and insanity), this one-shot will be more good-natured.!!

5:40 PM|MAAAAAAAGICAL U|George||Welcome one and all to Prim University, a school where witches, wizards, warlocks, and weirdos go to train their magical abilities and become true magical masters. However something not quite magical has found it's way into Prim's pristine and glamorous hallways. A NORMAN (Person who has no magical powers) has infiltrated the school and begun attending lessons! Are they a spy? An investigator? A saboteur? Or maybe they're just some unlucky loser who wound up here accidentally. Players (4-6) will take on the roles of students (and NORMAN) and attempt to figure out who exactly doesn't belong. This is a custom game made up entirely by George Fee. D10's will be the only die used and a lot of roleplaying is expected.!!
