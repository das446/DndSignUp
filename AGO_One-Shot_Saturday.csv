11:00 AM|Eleventh Hour|Kamal (afroCAN#2315)|40K.png|"It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries, the Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day so that He may never truly die. Yet in His deathless state, the Emperor continues His eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies engage in battle in His name on uncounted worlds, but for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants, and worse. To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruellest and most bloody regime imaginable.”<br>
Only War is a military roleplaying game in which players take the roles of Imperial Guardsmen in the Warhammer 40,000 universe.

11:00 AM|Scion Heroes|Vince (Adeylis#3647)|scion.png|It is the year 2050 for awhile not much have changed. However there have been reports of mysterious creatures and monsters appearing in various places. You the player are assumed to be like any other human beings. However throughout your life you appear to be better than the average human being. Weirdly enough you've been gift a random item with the sender claiming to be your parent. You grasp the item in hand, with it you receive a surge of mystical power. You are now a scion, a soon to be demigod of your parent god, but just who is this mythical parent? That is what you will find out, Journey the world and uncover its hidden secrets. Scion heroes is a mythological tabletop rpg. Where players play as an offspring of a god of the existing pantheons that we know of. They will have powers and potential to shape what they will become. This game runs similarly to exalted as a D10 success based system. In this system players roll a number of D10s to pass a threshold inorder determine whether they succeed in an action. However I'll be using a fan modified version of the original that will be more friendly to new players.!!
11:00 AM|Hyperlanes Gamma|Michael (Torchik#5226)|hyperlanes.png|The Year 3800, has been a major success for space exploration, alien contact, and the advancement of technology. Your crew is a mercenary task force that has a good reputation within the Alliance, you are stationed on the outer regions of explored space, where Alliance control is slim. Because of this, bandits are far more common than usual, some are former Alliance ships that have defected, others may have been formed by a third party. How will you and your crew face this unknown territory brimming with danger all around?<br>

11:00 AM|World Without Light|George (VirtualTitan#3867)|light.png|Imagine a world where light is a rarity, where utter and complete darkness reigns supreme, and where mankind is in a constant fight for its life against the ever encroaching shadows. Players will take on the role of elite adventurers who were hired to find and deal with a strange monster that has been driving people insane while creating horrifying abominations. World Without Light is a custom system primarily based on the Warhammer d100 systems. Players will have to be careful as physical injury is not the only way their character can fall in combat. Insanity is a common affliction in this world and the darkness that surrounds them has a strange way of corrupting those who venture into it without a source of light. All players are welcome, but be warned that while fun is guaranteed, victory and survival are not. There is space for 4-6!!

However something not quite magical has found it's way into Prim's pristine and glamorous hallways. A NORMAN (Person who has no magical powers) has infiltrated the school and begun attending lessons! Are they a spy? An investigator? A saboteur? Or maybe they're just some unlucky loser who wound up here accidentally. Players (4-6) will take on the roles of students (and NORMAN) and attempt to figure out who exactly doesn't belong. This is a custom game made up entirely by George Fee. D10's will be the only die used and a lot of roleplaying is expected.!!

There are the Dragon-Blooded, the Lunars, the Sidereals, and the Solars whose history is stained with slander and blood. The Solars once ruled creation until they were betrayed by the Sidereals and Dragon-Blooded. This was many years ago in the Golden Age. Now in the Bronze Age, the Dragon-Blooded rule and have convinced most people that Solars are mere daemons taking the form of the person whom they have killed. This brought rise to the Wild Hunt, a group of elite Dragon-Blooded who hunt Solars across the world.To ensure that a solar's spirit would not seek vengeance they are buried in lavish tombs full of treasures, artifacts, and dangerous traps and now after weeks of dangerous travel you find yourself mere moments away from the tomb of the legendary artificer, The Ingenuity of Forsaken Wisdom. Exalted is a High Fantasy Cinematic RPG system. You play as a Solar one of the chosen exalts of the Unconquered Sun, an already exception person granted more power to use as you see fit. This is a D10 system that measures numbers of successes in order to determine how well you handled the task. The game has a more abstract combat system with initiative being the edge you hold over your opponent not just when you act as well as a stunting system which grants the player bonuses for better and more creative descriptions for their actions.(edited)!!

2:20 PM|A Past That Could Have Been|Chelsea (SolarEclipse#7789)|BlackVoid.png|“In the days when Babylon was the greatest city on Earth, mankind lived in placid ignorance of the grandeur, vastness, and horror of the Cosmos... though such tranquility does not often last. A series of deafening rumbles shook the Earth and black mist began to fill the heavens. Mankind stared in horrified awe as the sky itself seemed to rip apart, revealing massive shadowy figures and incomprehensible darkness. As Earth was torn asunder, the truth of existence was revealed. Ripped from their home and scattered across the Cosmos, humanity was forced into a new struggle for survival in a far more cruel and chaotic world…” Generations later, you are the descendants of those few humans that managed to survive. Whether by luck or skill, you find yourself in the city Llyhn the Eternal– working to raise humanity to its rightful place among the stars.  You will play as members of the Assembly, a section of the Faerdani Enclave that works to foster diplomatic relationships with various emissaries in Llyhn. You have been selected to assist a Bai’Waikh expeditionary mission on a recently discovered world believed to have been home to an older branch of their civilization. 
<br><b>Mechanics:</b>
Black Void is a high-horror, low-fantasy role playing game with Eldritch horror and ancient Middle Eastern themes. The system uses a D12 DC Check system and manoeuver-based combat. It is freeform and suited well to both intrigue and combat focused campaigns where every choice has its benefits as well as its drawbacks.
<br><b>Warning:</b> While this system does contain serious topics and graphic scenes (mostly concerning slavery, semi-graphic violence, and insanity), this one-shot will be more good-natured.!!
